1. How do you implement multiple inheritance in java?

 We can not have multiple inheritance(using extends keyword) in Java due to the diamond problem and to provide simplicity.
 But a class can implement multiple interfaces(using implements keyword)
 
2. How do you restrict a member of a class from inheriting to it's sub classes?
  
 By declaring that member as a private. Because, private members are not inherited to sub classes.

3. Are constructors and initializers also inherited to sub classes?

  No, Constructors and initializers (Static initializers and instance initializers) are not inherited to sub classes. 
  But, they are executed while instantiating a sub class.

4. Are static members inherited to sub classes?

  No. Static members cannot be inherited. However super class and the sub class can have static method with same signature.
  Super class static member will be hidden at the sub class.
  
5. Can we use a field or a method declared without access modifiers outside the package?
  
  When we do not explicitly declare an access modifier for a field, method, etc., it gets the default access modifier which is 'package-private'.
  So it can not be used outside the package.
 
6. Can a top level class be private or protected? 
   
  No. A top level class can not be private or protected. It can have either "public" or no modifier.
